Modern managers must master the art of persuasive communication, adapt to the needs of the audience, construct a good narrative and inspire the audience to act (Communicate with Impact). They must learn to design and negotiate both informal and complex agreements, and do this in diverse workplace cultures (Negotiate and Resolve Conflict).\\n\\nThe Specialization applies influencing methods in two areas of great importance: change management and risk governance. Successful change management eludes many individuals and organizations, so we propose a new approach to enable you to inspire and lead transformations (Manage Change). Similarly, in the post-financial crisis environment, many organizations acknowledge the need for effective risk governance but few, if any, have achieved it.

This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.\\n\\nIn the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.\\n\\nThe second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.\\n\\nThe third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.\\n\\nAt the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.\"\"\"\\n\\n    Learning objectives, subject and student level:',\n",

Dentro de este marco, el Objetivo de Desarrollo Sostenible n&uacute;mero 17 destaca las ventajas de las alianzas estrat&eacute;gicas para lograr que esa agenda se haga efectiva. Las alianzas nos permiten analizar problemas desde diferentes perspectivas y proporcionar soluciones m&aacute;s integrales, y favorecen el apalancamiento de recursos, el intercambio de conocimientos, la transferencia de tecnolog&iacute;as y la ejecuci&oacute;n efectiva de programas de desarrollo.Pero, trabajar en alianza exige un cambio de perspectiva, una nueva forma de relacionarse con nuestros socios, una forma diferente de dividir las responsabilidades, tomar decisiones y monitorear los resultados.&iquest;Estamos preparados para trabajar en alianza? El siguiente MOOC, coordinado por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo y la Red de Soluciones de Desarrollo Sostenible de Naciones Unidas, se presenta como una gu&iacute;a pr&aacute;ctica para promover e implementar alianzas para el desarrollo sostenible.Concretamente, el curso analiza el concepto de alianza y el marco de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible. Adicionalmente, analiza los diferentes actores que suelen participar en este tipo de alianzas y las &aacute;reas recomendadas por Naciones Unidas para la implementaci&oacute;n de alianzas para el desarrollo sostenible.El curso ofrece, adem&aacute;s, herramientas y buenas pr&aacute;cticas para promover, crear, gestionar, gobernar y evaluar y monitorear alianzas. Y analiza las principales habilidades a desplegar para la implementaci&oacute;n efectiva de este tipo de alianzas.El curso combina lecturas te&oacute;ricas con m&uacute;ltiples casos reales, y ofrece m&uacute;ltiples actividades pr&aacute;cticas para que la experiencia de aprendizaje sea amena y efectiva. Tambi&eacute;n cuenta con las perspectivas de diversos actores, como expertos de las Naciones Unidas y del BID, l&iacute;deres empresariales, funcionarios p&uacute;blicos y representantes de ONGs y otras entidades.Esta capacitaci&oacute;n puede resultar de gran utilidad para quien trabaja en programas de desarrollo sostenible, principalmente funcionarios p&uacute;blicos, pero tambi&eacute;n agentes del sector privado, tercer sector, universidades o fundaciones trabajando en estos temas.\"\"\"\\n\\n    Learning objectives, subject and student level:',\n",

We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.\\r\\nThe two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.\\r\\nLouv1.1x (Fundamentals) covers functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You&rsquo;ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.\\r\\nLouv1.2x (Abstraction and Concurrency) covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You&rsquo;ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You&rsquo;ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.\\r\\nTo learn more about the practical organization of the two courses, watch the introductory video.\"\"\"\\n\\n    Learning objectives, subject and student level:',\n",

We will be using the Keras Sequential API with Tensorflow 2 as the backend.\\n\\nIn our GAN setup,  we want to be able to sample from a complex, high-dimensional training distribution of the Fashion MNIST images. However, there is no direct way to sample from this distribution. The solution is to sample from a simpler distribution, such as Gaussian noise. We want the model to use the power of neural networks to learn a transformation from the simple distribution directly to the training distribution that we care about. The GAN consists of two adversarial players: a discriminator and a generator. We’re going to train the two players jointly in a minimax game theoretic formulation.\\n\\nThis course runs on Coursera\\'s hands-on project platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops containing all of the software and data you need for the project. Everything is already set up directly in your internet browser so you can just focus on learning. For this project, you’ll get instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and Keras pre-installed.\\n\\nNotes:\\n-  You will be able to access the cloud desktop 5 times. However, you will be able to access instructions videos as many times as you want.\\n- This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

What is meant by persistent storage is that when a user exits an app and then restart it, the app will remember some information that the user gave it previously.  This app has four input boxes where the user is being asked to enter a name, address, phone number, and email address. Beneath that section the user will be asked to use radio buttons to indicate the part of the day they prefer, Morning, Afternoon, Evening, or Night.  The ability to save and retrieve information is a fundamental part of practically all apps and is essential knowledge for any aspiring app developer and those who like to create apps out of curiosity for fun.\\n\\nProjects in Series 1:\\n1.

Creating your survey will depend on what your company wants to analyze. Are customers satisfied with the products offered?  Or, are customers satisfied with the services offered? You have the option of deciding the specifics of the survey based on your company’s needs. In this course, you will create a survey to determine if customers are satisfied with the services of an appliance repair company. Once you have created and collected your survey responses, you will analyze the results using graphs provided by the Google form.  Graphs are a great visual tool that allows you to quickly see different trends occurring within your business, instead of having to shuffle through pages of a report. In this project, your graph will visually show you customer satisfaction ratings. Creating a survey gives you the ability to review customer feedback, and allows you to more accurately adjust your business practices to fit the needs of your customers. Doing so will help your company improve products and/or services for increased customer satisfaction, and in the long run, increase your business’s bottom line.\\n\\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Tables are used as the containers for the data in a database. As such, the structure, or makeup, of each table in a relational database is critical, since it must be designed and created specifically to meet the needs of the data it will contain. The table’s structure indicates which pieces of data are stored in a table, as well as the type and size of each piece of data. \\n\\nThroughout the course, you’ll be exposed to guidelines and rules that database designers use to make sure that the tables will keep the data as safe and accurate as possible. You’ll learn to use SQL code to incorporate the constraints that help the database management enforce those rules. As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you’ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  Tables that are well-designed and created correctly improve data integrity--and make data retrieval easier!\\n\\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.\"\"\"\\n\\n    Learning objectives, subject and student level:',\n",

It is essential that algorithms operating on these data sets operate as efficiently as possible. One measure used is called Big-O time complexity. It is often expressed not in terms of clock time, but rather in terms of the size of the data it is operating on. For example, in terms of an array of size N, an algorithm may take N^2 operations to complete. Knowing how to calculate Big-O gives the developer another tool to make software as good as it can be and provides a means to communicate performance when reviewing code with others.\\n\\nIn this course, you will analyze several algorithms to determine Big-O performance. You will learn how to visualize the performance using the graphing module pyplot.\\n\\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

It starts with common challenges and human resource issues faced by private business. It then teaches you essential financial accounting skills for entrepreneurs, such as creating and interpreting cash flow, balance sheet, and income statements to make financial health conclusions.\\n\\nThis specialization also presents an exciting new approach to values-driven leadership development in the workplace, in business education, and in life. In an action oriented introduction to Giving Voice to Values (GVV), it is not about persuading people to be more ethical, but instead starts from the premise that most of us already want to act on our values, and we feel that we have a reasonable chance of doing so effectively. It then discusses the emergence of a new story about business, contextualizing it within a societal framework. Finally, it teaches you to write innovative business plans, by driving meaningful focus, forcing specificity, and bringing linkages between key business drivers to the foreground.\"\"\"\\n\\n    Learning objectives, subject and student level:',\n",

Do words like \"algebra\\' and \"calculus\" fill you with dread? Has it been so long since you studied math at school that you\\'ve forgotten much of what you learned in the first place?\\nYou\\'re not alone. Machine learning and AI are built on mathematical principles like Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics, and Optimization; and many would-be AI practitioners find this daunting. This course is not designed to make you a mathematician. Rather, it aims to help you learn some essential foundational concepts and the notation used to express them. The course provides a hands-on approach to working with data and applying the techniques you\\'ve learned.\\nThis course is not a full math curriculum. It\\'s not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you\\'ll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.\\nedX offers financial assistance for learners who want to earn Verified Certificates but who may not be able to pay the fee. To apply for financial assistance, enroll in the course, then follow this link to complete an application for assistance.\\nNote: These courses will retire in June.

Currently, this is taken advantage of by the most valuable companies in Silicon Valley, the most powerful governmental agencies, and the most influential social movements. What they have in common is that they use computational tools to understand, and ultimately influence human behavior and social dynamics.\\n\\nAn increasing part of human interaction leaves a massive digital footprint behind. Studying it allows us to gain unprecedented insights into what society is and how it works, including its intricate social networks that had long been obscure. Computational power allows us to detect hidden patterns through analytical tools like machine learning and to natural language processing. Finally, computer simulations enable us to explore hypothetical situations that may not even exist in reality, but that we would like to exist: a better world.\\n\\nThis specialization serves as a multidisciplinary, multi-perspective, and multi-method guide on how to better understand society and human behavior with modern research tools. This specialization gives you easy access to some of the exciting new possibilities of how to study society and human behavior.
